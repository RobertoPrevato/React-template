# React-template
This project template is an application skeleton for React web applications using ES6 transpilation and Gulp task runner.
It contains a sample application and is preconfigured to offer integration with Gulp, for common tasks.

The project template offers an example of client side technology stack, featuring:
* Integration with Gulp task runner
* Transpilation of code from ES6 to ES5
* Gulp watch task, to monitor files for changes and automatically bundle the code during development
* Fast JavaScript bundling, using watchify together with browserify
* Strategy to organize the source code (both JavaScript and LESS), into logical areas
* Example of client side routing, using [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
* Client side localization strategy
* Integration with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Strategy to display preloaders and error panels
* Example of React components definition, using ES6 class
* Compilation of LESS code into CSS
* Application wise, declarative and asynchronous forms validation strategy, using [Dataentry](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/DataEntry)
